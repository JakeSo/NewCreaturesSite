    <h2 class="heading">About The Creatures</h2>
    <p>The New Creatures was founded in the quiet town of McAdenville, NC just outside the bustling metropolis of Charlotte. Childhood friends <span class="name">Conrad Sloand</span> (guitar, vocals, piano) and <span class="name">John Carstarphen</span> (guitar, vocals, harmonica) became playing folk music together in high school and eventually
      joined up with college pals <span class="name">Ben Carroll</span> (guitar, vocals) and <span class="name">Bjarne Nielsen</span> (bass, vocals) in the summer of 2019. After fleeting stints with a few drummers, they found solace in the barbaric rock 'n' roll style of <span class="name">Jacob "Dino" Palladino</span>'s drumming.
      By October 2019, <span class="name">The New Creatures</span> were complete. The Creatures have recently adopted a new bass player called <span class="name"> Jordan Deans </span>from Charlotte. Deans has seamlessly injected his high energy personality into the already bombastic live performances that the band has become known for over the past year or so.
      Embracing sounds of 60's rockers with flavorful hints of indie, garage rock and surf rock, the tranquil quietness of McAdenville was soon disturbed ultimately spurring the construction of a soundproof jam room in their house they have dubbed <br /> <span class="name">The Creature Farm</span>. </p>
    <p > While home base for their live performances has been Charlotte, they have made their way across the region and beyond, playing to crowds in Tennessee, Georgia, New York, Vermont, etc. etc.. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the boys were writing as much as possible.
      Their second full-length studio album released on August, 4th 2021 and entitled "Seed" was a direct result of the quarantine and isolation that they and the rest of the globe experienced. Cathartically, the band was able to host a sold out album release party at Snug Harbor in Charlotte. Coming out of the pandemic, the boys have been playing loads of house shows as well as venues and clubs around the Charlotte area.
