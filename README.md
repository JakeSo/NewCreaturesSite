# NewCreaturesSite

This is my first site redesign I am working on. This site is for a local rock band, The New Creatures, which had a website that was not very responsive, so I began working on one using my knowledge of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. I am currently learning how to use JavaScript for web and hope to increase the sites cool factor with that.

The original site: https://www.thenewcreaturesband.com
