# NewCreaturesSite

This is my first site redesign I am working on. This site is for a local rock band, The New Creatures, which had a website that was not very responsive, so I began working on one using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I am currently learning how to use JavaScript for web, and hope to increase the site's cool factor with that.
